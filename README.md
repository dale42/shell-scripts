A collection of shells scripts for doing routine stuff on the command line.

## Overview

| Script               | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| ddev-drupalcreate.sh | Moved to [GitHub: dale42/ddev-scripts](https://github.com/dale42/ddev-scripts) |
| dropalltables        | Drop all tables in a database   |
| restore-db.sh        | Restore a sql dump file, compresses or uncompressed, to a database | 
| website-backup.sh    | Database and file backup of a Drupal or WordPress website  |

## dropalltables

Drop all the tables in the specified database.

**Usage:**

`dropalalltables username password database`

**Notes:**

- Assumes the host is localhost
- This will leave the database password on the command line history. If this is a concern, use the  `history -c` command to clear thie history, or use the technique described in this stackoverflow article: [Execute command without keeping it in history](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8473121/execute-command-without-keeping-it-in-history)


#restore-db.sh

Restores a sqldump or gzipped sqldump file to the specified database.

`restore-db.sh username password database sql-file.sql`

**Notes:**
- Assumes the host is localhost
- This will leave the database password on the command line history. If this is a concern, use the  `history -c` command to clear thie history, or use the technique described in this stackoverflow article: [Execute command without keeping it in history](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8473121/execute-command-without-keeping-it-in-history)


## website-backup.sh

A general purpose script for taking a database, file, or database and file backup of a Drupal or WordPress website. It autodetects the CMS and extracts the database credentials from the appropriate settings file.

**Usage:**

`website-backup.sh site-directory [db|file|full] [output-name-root] [output-directory]`

**Notes:**

- The Drupal settings.php file parse for database credentials is fragile. It currently assumes the settings file is in the sites/default directory.
